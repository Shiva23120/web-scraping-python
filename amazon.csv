0,Aadish Shah,5.0 out of 5 stars,"I am a SAT student who will be sitting the SAT exam this November. This book is excellent in terms of content- it synthesises the wealth of information on the web to exactly what you need for the essay, very concisely and succinctly. Very impressed. It also has headings for each respective chapter for relevant SAT essay topics, so you can use and practise them when writing essays. 5/5"

2,Dee R,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a great outline and has some nice examples in this book.  Written by a SAT prep tutor, so he obviously had a lot of experience in this field.  There are thirty different examples in this book and I actually enjoyed reading them.  My daughter will be doing taking this soon , and I believe this will be a great guide for her to follow.  It is the best guide I have found yet so far. Very detailed information.Great to come back to over and over and see the format of how to write your essay and what kind of details are needed.  The structure you need to follow and the work involved in each one.  There is a lot of time and research that needs to be done with for your essay, and I really like all the examples in this book, I actually learned a lot when reading these examples.  Thanks for the great tool, and I really recommended any that will be doing the SAT soon to read this guide, and use it as a tool in your studies."
3,uktravailer,5.0 out of 5 stars,"This is a useful book for SAT practice. My daughter was able to increase her SAT score significantly by understanding how the SATs are reviewed and graded. It's not a short cut but it does help practice the test and allow you to focus on what's important. It is beyond my understanding why the school system in our area doesn't use such a tool rather than leaving it to the kids to have to navigate this area on their own. This is not cheating, it simply explains what the examiners are looking for.Highly recommended."
4,sam,4.0 out of 5 stars,"Don't just rely on these examples... After you learn 5 out of 30 examples from this book, as recommended by author...you should still practice for making up examples if you need to...for example I had a SAT essay in which no example from this would fit..It was a hard essay but this book has examples suitable for 75% SAT essay's..."
5,Enj,4.0 out of 5 stars,"This book was pretty helpful in giving me ideas to write in the SAT.However, the length of the examples are not consistent. Some are detailed while others are rather short"
6,TOM,5.0 out of 5 stars,"A an established SAT tutor, I found this book a big help to my students as it gives a broad range of examples with detailed explanations regarding the relevancy of each."
